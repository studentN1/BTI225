QUESTION 1

You are going to write a JavaScript program to accomplish the following task. Refer to sample output below. Note: please use the same data for testing.

Task1:

Create an array of 4 customers, each customer is an object, with the following 3 properties and 1 function. properties:

firstName: string, customer's first name lastName: string, customer's last name

moneySpent: array of 3 numbers which stands for the money the customer spent for 3 products e.g, [ 1080.89, 783.23, 68.09]

which means this customer spent $1080.89 for "product1",

$783.23 for "product2",

$68.09 for "product3"

function:

getTotal: calculate the total amount the customer spent for the three products, and return that total amount.

Task2:

For each customer, display the information as follows:

(first name last name) is a

( level ) customer for ( product1 ),

( level ) customer for ( product2 )

( level ) customer for ( product3 )

In total, he spent $(total amount, obtained from the above object function: getTotal()).

where: level is one of the following under the corresponding condition:

"super": if the customer spent over and including $1000

"good": if the customer spent over and including $500 and less than $1000 "potential": if the customer spent less than $500

 

refer to the following sample output.

 

Important: You can hard code the data for the 4 customers, but cannot hard-code the calculation or the display. Your program should be able to easily extend to 10 or 1000 customers in the future.

 

Data:

You need to construct the array of 4 customer objects based on the following data: First Name | Last Name | Money Spent for (product1, product2, product3)

========================================================================

"First1"      "Last1"       1080.89, 783.23, 68.09

"First2"      "Last2"       80.89, 73.23, 1368.09

"First3"      "Last3"       580.89, 7083.23, 608.09

"First4"      "Last4"       100.89, 1783.23, 6.09

 

Sample output: first1 last1 is a

Super customer for product1, good customer for product2, potential customer for product3.

 

In total, he spent $1932.21 for all products.

===============================================

 

first2 last2 is a

potential customer for product1, potential customer for product2, Super customer for product3.

 

In total, he spent $1522.21 for all products.

===============================================

 

first3 last3 is a

good customer for product1,

Super customer for product2, good customer for product3.

 

In total, he spent $8272.21 for all products.

===============================================

 

first4 last4 is a

potential customer for product1, Super customer for product2, potential customer for product3.

 

In total, he spent $1890.21 for all products.
